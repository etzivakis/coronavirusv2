#Evelyn Tzivakis R coding project 30/3/2020
#Plotting coronavirus cases worldwide using data from John Hopkins University 

#install packages needed for project 
#(note to Dani: I was having major issues installing tidyverse for this project on my PC; R studio was telling me it had installed the packages but nothing was happening
#- so I just installed the three packages that the project owner suggested were needed)

install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")

#create an overview table of the number of confirmed cases, arranged in date order and filtering for cases of 10 or more 
#(i.e. from January, show dates where >10 new cases were confirmed and in what country)
overview_cases <- coronavirus %>% 
  rename (new_cases = cases) %>%
  filter(new_cases > 10) %>%
  arrange((date)) %>%
#from original 'coronavirus' file, only want to include variables Country.Region, new_cases, and date 
  select(Country.Region, new_cases, date)

#read 'coronavirus_dataset' file into 'confirmed_cases_worldwide'
confirmed_cases_worldwide <- read.csv("coronavirus_dataset.csv")

#plot picture of confirmed coronavirus cases over the entire time period for which we have data for 
picture <- ggplot(data=coronavirus)+
#line graph - x axis = date, y axis = cases, change colour gradient of lines to reflect number of cases on a particular date
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date, y=cases, colour=cases))+
#change y axis label to 'cumulative confirmed cases worldwide'
  ylab("cumulative confirmed cases worldwide")+
#change x axis date scale to reflect cumulative number of confirmed cases every week 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "7 day")
plot(picture)
